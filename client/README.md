# Sprint Meeting Notes:

- 12/5 Spoke about getting GitHub set up and working so we can all have access to a working repo. Talked about how we will go about pulling and pushing changes through the terminal so the changes can be reviewed. Assigned tasks for sprint 1. Amy began work on creating the front end framework with pages and components, as well as their basic styling template so our changes can be seen in the browser. 

- 12/6 Resolved issues with GitHub visibility. Spoke about backend tasks and how they are similar but separate from one another. 

- 12/7 Looked at sports API progress and how other pages can be modeled from that. Browsed over national news page and decided that search would be by city name instead of zip code due to the increased complexity and topics we are unfamiliar with in searching by zip code. Looked over world news page. Discussed API limit of 100 requests per day and caching to optimize each request. 

- 12/9 Discussed progress with our individual tasks and found we have no blockers yet. Discussed completed tasks. 

- 12/10 Assigned user profile management to Dylan to start on the user model and connections with the backend. Reviewed Mireille's weather page and current errors related to pulling and pushing to the hub. 

- 12/11 Brainstormed what we want to show on the home page. Instead of overloading the page with updates from each category, we decided to pull in local news, weather, and sports updates based on the user profile location and favorite sports teams. 

- 12/12 Discovered that we will need a user log in component in order to store the user preferences. Dylan is working on that within his user preferences task. 

- 12/13 Helped Mereille get weather page changes pushed and changed access on MongoDB to allow for successful connection.
