# Sprint Meeting Notes:

- 12/5 Spoke about getting GitHub set up and working so we can all have access to a working repo. Talked about how we will go about pulling and pushing changes through the terminal so the changes can be reviewed. Assigned tasks for sprint 1. Amy began work on creating the front end framework with pages and components, as well as their basic styling template so our changes can be seen in the browser. 

- 12/6 Resolved issues with GitHub visibility. Spoke about backend tasks and how they are similar but separate from one another. 

- 12/7 Looked at sports API progress and how other pages can be modeled from that. Browsed over national news page and decided that search would be by city name instead of zip code due to the increased complexity and topics we are unfamiliar with in searching by zip code. Looked over world news page. Discussed API limit of 100 requests per day and caching to optimize each request. 

- 12/9 Discussed progress with our individual tasks and found we have no blockers yet. Discussed completed tasks. 

- 12/10 Assigned user profile management to Dylan to start on the user model and connections with the backend. Reviewed Mireille's weather page and current errors related to pulling and pushing to the hub. 

- 12/11 Brainstormed what we want to show on the home page. Instead of overloading the page with updates from each category, we decided to pull in local news, weather, and sports updates based on the user profile location and favorite sports teams. 

- 12/12 Discovered that we will need a user log in component in order to store the user preferences. Dylan is working on that within his user preferences task. 

- 12/13 Helped Mireille get weather page changes pushed and changed access on MongoDB to allow for successful connection.

- 12/14 Spoke about clickup and open tasks. Brandon will have changes pushed by Saturday. Dylan and Timothy are also working on back end tune ups.

- 12/15 Working on sign up and sign in auths. Added a few more pages and fixed sports break // todolist = add nav bar/links for better navigation  inside sports section ,embed more content, add youtube sport updates maybe ,implement profile settings ,combine nflcard with nfl.news, css for styling, pics too big. Discussed using router for sign up.

- 12/16 Fixing kinks and adding more content for sports section and making sure all api resources and filtering articles to get best results, all fetching routes are in place and sorting through the $query selectors to get the relevant data 

- 12/17 Dylan to link the sign up, user profile page to the rest of the pages & setting up auth

- 12/18 Spoke about what we are working on. Mireille is looking into options for forecast and city, state search in Weather. Brandon is still working on the sports page. 

- 12/19 Mireille says it looks like she will need a different API to implement a 5-day forecast but is not working on trying to specify a state in the search. 

- 12/20 Amy still working on CSS of changes made. Dylan's bug notes "I reverted the changes I made at the sign up as it wasn't working. I am trying it again and I am getting a 404. I looked on the backend and I see there is an extra set of sign up and sign in post requests."

- 12/21 Brandon added caching to sports section. Presentation notes from Cody- everything looks good so far. When asked if there are any 'extra touches' features he would like to see on a site like this he suggested a bookmark option for each article and a share button. Dylan's bug 10:56PM update: "I'm taking a look at the database and we have over 2,000 documents just in users alone. I think when I had tested a while ago, it must've sent in the sign up request quite a bit as most of them are for a single attempt I did. I am wondering if something is going on on my computer, maybe why I am still getting 404." 11:16PM update: "I found an issue. I had a couple 'desktops' going on my computer and I had the terminal up and going on the other one. I am good and clear at the moment. There is still the matter of the 2k users to deal with. I think it would be wise to wipe them all and build fresh data again."

- 12/23 Dylan's bug update: "I was able to delete only the duplicates. We are now sitting at 7 users. Y'all should be able to sign in as normal."

- 12/26 Tim added a stocks page with limited API queries per day. 

- 12/28 Spoke about what we are currently working on. Dylan is working on his user profile and preferences task and should have it completed by 12/29. Brandon is working on possibly implementing videos on  his page. Amy making CSS updates as progress is made but waiting on sports page to be finalized before adding any more CSS that might get overridden with the changes. Mireille still working on weather page. Meeting scheduled for 12/29 to discuss Dylan's progress and other changes made.
